                <p><strong>Description: </strong>Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have been widely used as a key wireless technology to support ubiquitous coverage of wireless Internet access. WMN is composed of a combination of static mesh routers (MRs) and mobile mesh clients (MCs). A mobile mesh client also called a mesh node (MN). The MNs are the terminal devices to which the WMN backbone provides connectivity. The mesh routers are usually stationary and connected with each other by wireless link in an ad hoc manner to form the network backbone. Generally, mesh routers have enhanced capabilities in comparison to mesh clients such as higher transmit power, multiple receive/transmit interfaces, unlimited power supply, etc. In a typical WMN, some MRs serve as wireless access points (APs) to provide wireless mesh backbone entries to MCs. Some MRs are called gateway MRs which are connected to the Internet via wired links and serve as Internet entry points to other MRs via single-hop or multi-hop wireless links. This chapter contains some introductory information on Denial of service attack in wireless mesh network, motivation of our work, challenges of implementing our work and our objectives.
                    <br> <b>	Denial of Service Attack</b>
                    A denial-of-service attack is characterized by an explicit attempt by attackers to prevent legitimate users of a service from using that service [1].WMN uses multiple radios and relies on a high-speed back-haul network itself, often wireless that optimizes network performance and provides gateways to the wired Internet and other wireless services [10].

                    Due to multihop routing in wireless mesh network, it is prone to various types of Denials of Service (DoS) attacks. DoS attacks are commonplace in the wireless network. Guarding against DoS attacks is a critical component of any security system. Traditional DoS attacks involve overwhelming a particular host.
